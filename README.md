# selfstudy-IBP
Self-study notes for Indian Buffet Process, from reading through "The Indian Buffet Process: An Introduction and Review", Griffiths, Ghahramani, 2011

There are three sections currently:

- [ibp_section1.ipynb](ibp_section1.ipynb) revision of multinomial distributions, Dirichlet distributions, mixture models
- [ibp_section2.ipynb](ibp_section2.ipynb) Latent class models
- [ibp_section3.ipynb](ibp_section3.ipynb) Latent feature models
- [ibp_section4.ipynb](ibp_section4.ipynb) Example: Linear-Gaussian Latent Feature Model with Binary Features (in progress)

## news

- 2015 jan 11: just discovered that when the notebooks are displayed in the github viewer, any consecutive equations are displayed showing only the last equation
  - a temporary workaround for this is to put `&nbsp;` between the equations, which is a bit ugly, but better than skipping equations
