Note that $\\pi_k$ is only conditional on $\\mathbf{z}_{-i,k}$, dont need to consider $\\mathbf{z}$ for other features, since they dont give any information on the latent variable $\\pi_k$. Each $\\pi_k$ is conditionally independent of other $\\pi_k$, given the prior distribution, ie we are using Dirichlet, and its hyperparameter $\\alpha$.\n",
