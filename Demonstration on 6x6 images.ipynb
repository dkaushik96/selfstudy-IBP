    "For sampling from the posterior, per the tutorial, we should use the tutorial's equation 22.  But there's a proportional-to sign, $\\propto$.  How to handle this?  Since I'm not trying to do this research from scratch, just reproduce/understand the existing research, I reached out to Mr Google, to look for more explanations.  I found a video from Finale Doshi-Velez, and interluded out to her \"accelerated sampling\" presentation, slides and paper.  The interlude is at: [accelerated_gibbs_samplings.ipynb](accelerated_gibbs_sampling.ipynb).  So, if you're trying to follow along with my own thought processes, challenges, solutions, etc, you might want to go there now.  Or you can just continue, it's all good :-)\n",

    "From reaching out to Doshi-Velez's presentation, it looks like we can sample a distribution that is only provided in proportionality, as long as it has a shape, which is well-defined, that we know how to sample from, ie typically a Gaussian.  There are probably other ways of handling other distributions, but a Gaussian should be reasonably straightforward to sample from, if we can get the distribution in that form.  Let's reach right back to the first section, and see what distribution(s) we need to sample from.\n",
